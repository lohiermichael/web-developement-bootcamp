# Introduction to Express

* What is a framework? How is it different from a library?

The main difference is called **Inversion of Control**, namely all the control flow is in the framework compared to a library where you call the functions or methods. It basically allows us to use all the basic work for an application as a pre-made package.

* What is Express?

It is a Web Development Framework

* Why are we using Express?

    1. Most used framework (at that time)
    2. It is a lightweight framework, you can change a lot
    
# Our First Express App!!!

* Review an existing app (DogDemo)

The needed steps are as followed:
    1. SETUP: use require to install Express as a framework and the needed libraries
    2. DATABASE STUFF:  reference the database that we will be using
    3. ROUTES: receiving the GET, POST  and other requests and run some specific code in function of these requests
    In  routes, we finally host the application on a server or a local port.
