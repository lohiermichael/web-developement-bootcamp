# Databases

## 1. Intro to Databases

* What is a database?

It is a a collection of information/data
It has a interface, i.e. a language to interact with it.

* SQL (relational) VS. noSQL (non-relational)

There are two types of databases:
    1. **SQL (relational)**: they are ol. They are tabular and flat namely each instance of a table follows the same patten, has the same attributes. I implies the use of **Join tables**.
    It is not really flexible in the context of Web Development. For instance, if we wan to add a new attribute for only one element of the table, we have to set it to ***null*** for all the other elements of the table.
    2. **NoSQL (no-relational)**: we don't have to define patterns. They are more flexible. Other good points: data can be nested. Ex: a person can have an address which can have a street. It looks similar to JSON structure.

## 2. Intro to MongoDB

* What is MongoDB?

It is a noSQL database

* Why are we using it?

We could have used PostgreSQL or mySQL but the most popular non-relational database is MongoDB now.

* Install it
